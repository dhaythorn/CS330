1. How do I approach designing software?
  What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    I think I've learned a lot of about lighting and scene placement.
  What design process did you follow for your project work?
    I try to simply focus on each step of the project until it works the way I want it to.
  How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    Trying to understand my project fully along with the capabilities of my software stack will be more important to me in the future.
3. How do I approach developing programs?
  What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    Well, I learned a new concept to apply each week in this class.
  How did iteration factor into your development?
     I added each of them progressively to my project through milestones each week.
  How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
     I've come to understand OpenGL a lot better.
5. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
    These are the skills I hope to use in my field. I've been interested in game development for a while now.
